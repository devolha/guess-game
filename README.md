# Python Number Guess Game: Programming project 
This is a simple console game that asks to guess a random number from 1 to 10.
The program provides two options for communicating with the user:
- the input is below the main number
- the input is above the main number

The program also handles errors such as the number being out of range and non-integer value type.
